          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-theme-golden pr-2">Overview:</h4>
        
             Responsible Tourism Certificate Course is a six-month comprehensive overview course on eco-friendly and sustainable tourism. Learners will be instructed in the development of responsible and sustainable tourism practices and enterprises in and around the Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan regions. They will learn to tackle the problems that arise from mass tourism and receive guidance in inclusive tourism–bringing the tourism economy to rural areas that are remote and haven’t benefited from the travel economy yet. <br>
The primary aim of this course is to understand the negative impacts of the conventional tourism industry and bring about changes through sustainable, responsible, innovative solutions. The course is designed to give a clear insight into the consequences of tourism planning and policymaking on the environment, society, culture, and the economy. During the program, we offer students both theoretical and practical knowledge.
