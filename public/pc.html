             HIAL is working towards greening its 120-acre campus through native and drought-tolerant plants plantation. For this, we have identified the native vegetation of Ladakh and are sourcing the planting material from various places. We are also setting up a nursery & a seed bank which will make us self-reliant in terms of Saplings & Seeds over the next 2 years. Thereafter, we are also working on documenting ‘Plants of Ladakh; in terms of propagation techniques and seed availability. With this, we will be able to utilize our lessons from this project for desert greening initiatives of HIAL and later on to grow multiple forests across different regions of Ladakh. <br>
            Along with this, the plantation department will also train the local youths in projects such as valley greening, nursery development, apple orchards, and composting. These research varied techniques that would be useful for this region.
