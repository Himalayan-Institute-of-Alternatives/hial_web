            ABOUT HILLS FELLOWSHIP:
          </h4>
          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
            The HILLs (Himalayan Institute of Live Learnings) fellowship is an
            eleven-month fully immersive trans-disciplinary postgraduate
            programme, which brings young (at heart) individuals who are
            passionate about tackling the challenges faced by the Hindu Kush
            Himalayas and the other mountain ranges of the world. The selection
            for the fellowship is highly competitive with limited seats and the
            candidates are selected on the basis of their interest,
            solution-mindedness and the vision ("Big Idea") that they wish to
            work upon during their stay in the fellowship. HILLs fellowship is
            aimed at finding indigenous solutions to local problems through the
            pedagogy of experiential learning in the context of the mountains.
            It aims to expose the fellows to a diverse set of subjects and
            perspectives, delivered by some of the finest action academicians
            and practitioners from India and abroad. The aim is to empower the
            fellows in becoming social entrepreneurs and in achieving their "Big
            Idea". The fellows will learn-by-doing (experiential learning)
            things and majority of their learnings will come from live action
            labs (where they will learn by working alongside the local people in
            Ladakh). They will become well-rounded individuals who are able to
            think critically and systemically from multiple perspectives with a
            commitment to improving the quality of lives and livelihoods in the
            fragile Himalayan eco-system through sustainable social and
            entrepreneurial practices. HILLs fellowship is an intense and
            rigorous programme, which engages fellows in various
            multidisciplinary courses, working on the field with the local
            community and providing the opportunity to earn while learning.
            These are models that are unique to the HILLs fellowship and the
            pedagogy will require the students to contribute to the running of
            the courses as well as building of several aspects of the Institute
            during their fellowship programme, which will develop their
            governance, leadership and collaborative skills.

              on the basis of race, gender, religion, caste, nationality, ethnic
              origin, sexual orientation, age or disability. If fellows have any

              providing a safe environment for all the members of the programme,
              along with their visitors, and has strict policies on sexual
              harassment and violence on its premises. Sexual harassment
              includes any verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is
              directed towards an individual against their will or consent.
              Consent cannot be assumed if the individual is deemed unable to
              make a reasonable judgment about the nature of the activity (i.e.,
              they are intoxicated, on medication or of unsound mind). Violence
              is any physical conduct that threatens the physical, emotional and
              mental safety and health of an individual. Please report all
              complaints in this regard directly to the programme team and the
              student coordinators.

                The Institute will provide all necessary support to victims of
                sexual harassment and violence. The programme team will conduct
                a thorough investigation and submit its recommendations back to
                the Dean's office for appropriate action. The Dean will ensure
                that the programme team's recommendations are adhered to and
                violators will face appropriate disciplinary action. Sexual
                harassment and violence are grounds for immediate dismissal from
                the HILLs fellowship. The Institute will keep all findings and
                the investigations confidential.

              <b>Anti-ragging Policy:</b> Ragging is considered a grave offence
              and in conformity with the directives of the Honourable Supreme
              Court of India, the Institute exercises zero tolerance for all
              instances of ragging. If found guilty of the offence, the fellow
              will be dismissed from the programme immediately. Fellows must
              also ensure to immediately report instances of ragging if they
              come across any. Forcing someone to behave/act in any manner
              without their consent is considered ragging and any student
              feeling discomfort in these situations should register a
              complaint. Strict confidentiality will be maintained in case of
              any such complaints. If fellows wish to express a grievance about
              any fellow, faculty member or staff member, they may discuss the
              grievance with the programme team and their respective mentors.
