          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-theme-golden pr-2"> Course Overview:</h4>
        
           This documentary filmmaking workshop is anchored in the principles of deep ecology, and environmental philosophy that understands self as deeply connected with and as part of nature, not disassociated with it. Deep ecology critiques anthropocentrism and posits a biocentric worldview, whereby the human entity is not above or below any other natural entity, it is inherently equal to every other entity. <br>

This deep ecology perspective is interesting for documentary filmmaking, particularly of ethnographic nature, as it concurs with the worldview of most aboriginal cultures and close-knit indigenous communities – like in the case of Phyang, Leh-Ladakh – the field area of our workshop. <br>

Drawing inspiration from a biocentric worldview, the workshop is designed in the exploration of 3S: Self -Surrounding-Story, wherein we begin with introspection, and look around in response to inner curiosities and concerns. We are looking forward to building up narratives that spring from an authentic interaction of the self with the surrounding. The emerging stories we hope will have a personal touch and social value. <br>

We will put on the table challenging questions like the purpose of filmmaking or the position of the filmmaker, for instance, being an insider or an outsider. The perks of the position, the point of entry or the line of inquiry, the field of access, the sensitivity or the dynamism while approaching the subject. The workshop will take a philosophical approach while working out and demonstrating practical processes of filmmaking. <br>

Cinematographically, the light and the landscape of Ladakh will be explored. The landscape itself is extraordinary, and it transforms with light. The sunlight on the mountains and the valleys with picturesque farmlands, hamlets, markets, and monasteries will be explored. Moonland will be explored in Lamayuru mountains, nicknamed the ‘moonland’. <br>

In terms of sound, there is great scope for recording ambiance in villages/roads/marketplaces/monasteries, etc. Additionally, recording of folktales and folksongs will be encouraged for those who are interested in sound specifically. <br>

Intensive or specialized editing or sound mixing input may be difficult in the given framework, however basic orientation and mentorship enough for the team to be able to finalize their films’ edits will be given. <br>

Basically, workshop participants will be divided into groups, and the groups will be mentored to make their own films – through a guided plan – starting from self-awareness, interaction, exploration of the land, and observation of daily life patterns of the local people – to arrive at ideas for films. The groups will have to pitch their proposal through pitching sessions. Production plans for all films will be drawn by the supervisors. Participants will then have to shoot and edit their own films. <br>

This is a production-oriented workshop, and the films produced as a part of the workshop will have a public screening at the end of the workshop, followed by a Q&A session with the filmmakers. <br>

<ol>
    The 34-day workshop will be conducted broadly in 9 sections:
    <li>
        4 days- Introduction and General Orientation
    </li>
    <li>
        2 days- Academic conference – Understanding the socio-culture and geopolitics of Ladakh
    </li>
    <li>
        3 days- Landscape tour to experience 1st hand the ground realities and special spots
    </li>
    <li>
        4 days- Neighbourhood exploration in Phyang- the field area of our workshop
    </li>
    <li>
        5 days- Conceptual and Technical Inputs / Exercises for Documentary filmmaking

    <li>
        5 days- Pre-production and Pitching Sessions

    <li>

    </li>
</ol>
 <br>
Additionally 3 days prior to the workshop are recommended for acclimatization and 3 days after the workshop to keep in hand as a buffer to cover up any pending exercises or workshop deliverables. <br>

Thus in total, the workshop promises 40 days of experiential learning program – with films as the main tangible deliverable, along with other mini media objects and an archive of footage. <br>

<h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-theme-golden pr-2 pt-2">EQUIPMENT DETAILS :</h4>

We believe the equipment you have is the best equipment to make your film with. As you are familiar with your own equipment and you can learn to utilize it better for your own film. However, it is not mandatory to have your own equipment to participate in this workshop. <br>

If you do have any piece, like a camera or a tripod or any grips or an editing laptop or any recorders, we encourage you to bring it along. Participants will be making films in groups, so your equipment will be utilized for your own group. We hope the groups to be self-sufficient in terms of basic equipment like a camera, a tripod, and a recorder. <br>

From our side, we will try to provide for what is missing in each group.
